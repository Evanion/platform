# Platform
This is the meta project that handles the different platform codebases.
It also contains the config for VSC, in order to setup tools and environments

## Setup
Run `meta git clone https://github.com/Evanion/platform.git` in your terminal.
It will create a folder called `platform` in your CWD and clone the codebases in to that.
